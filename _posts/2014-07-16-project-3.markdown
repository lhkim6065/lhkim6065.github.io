description: "This project explores TikTok engagement using data from Kaggle, motivated by the TikTok ban signed by President Biden. My EDA involves examining the dataset structure, and focuses on certain variables within the dataset. Feature selection and transformation were crucial steps, particularly for logistic regression, where multicollinearity among the features was addressed by excluding certain variables, like video_like_count. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was attempted for dimensionality reduction, even though the dataset's low dimensionality made it less effective. For clustering, the k-means algorithm was applied, with the number of clusters determined by identifying an elbow point in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares. In this case, three clusters were chosen, and the data was visualized to show the distribution of videos based on engagement metrics. Finally, I suggested areas for further research, including optimizing models with hyperparameters and experimenting with different feature selections for the k-means analysis. Explore the detailed findings and analysis from my project through Binder, which will open my python file in an executable Juypter notebook: <a href='https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lhkim6065/lhkim6065.github.io.git/HEAD?labpath=Python%2FModeling+Project.ipynb' target='_blank'>database</a>"
