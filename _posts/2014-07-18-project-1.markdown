description: "For a final project, I tackled an extensive analysis on Kickstarter projects using Jonathan Leland's comprehensive dataset spanning from 2009 to 2020. This project allowed me to showcase my proficiency in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modeling within R Studio, while also enabling me to present compelling insights to a broad audience.
