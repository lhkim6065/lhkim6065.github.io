description: 'This project, created using R Studio, delves into the pressing issue of school shootings. The dataset includes incidents of various gunfire during school hours from 1999 to 2022. Key incidents highlighted include the tragic events at Robb Elementary School, Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The role of mental health and the alarming statistic that 78% of school shooters under 18 obtained their weapons from home are underscored. We concluded with a call to action for the promotion of safe storage laws to prevent unauthorized access to firearms.
