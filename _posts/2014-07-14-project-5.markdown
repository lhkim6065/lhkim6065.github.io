description: >
  The main objectives of this project was to create and manage a dataset using PostgreSQL. I demonstrated key database operations such as table creation with constraints, data import from CSV files, JOIN operations, data querying, and performing calculations while explaining my process to beginner and intermediate PostgreSQL learners. I was able to efficiently organize and analyze data from these practice datasets which enabled me to extract valuable insights.
